                    The word calisthenics comes from the ancient Greek words kállos
                    (κάλλος), which means "beauty" (to emphasize the aesthetic pleasure
                    that derives from the perfection of the human body), and sthenos
                    (σθένος), meaning "strength" (great mental strength, courage,
                    strength, and determination). It is the art of using one's body
                    weight as resistance in order to develop physique. The practice was
                    recorded in use in Ancient Greece, including the armies of Alexander
                    the Great and the Spartans at the Battle of Thermopylae.
                    Calisthenics was also recorded to have been in use in Ancient China.
                    Besides dieting, Han Dynasty physicians also prescribed calisthenics
                    as one of the methods of maintaining one's health.

                    Catharine Esther Beecher (1800 to 1878), was an American educator
                    and author who popularized and shaped a conservative ideological
                    movement to both elevate and entrench women's place in the domestic
                    sphere of American culture. She introduced calisthenics in a course
                    of physical education and promoted it. Disciples of Friedrich Ludwig
                    Jahn brought their version of gymnastics to the United States, while
                    Catharine Beecher and Dio Lewis set up physical education programs
                    for women in the 19th century.Organized systems of calisthenics in
                    America took a back seat to competitive sports after the Battle of
                    the Systems, when the states mandated physical education systems.The
                    Royal Canadian Air Force's calisthenics program published in the
                    1960s helped to launch modern fitness culture.

                </header>
                <p>The more commonly performed calisthenic exercises include:</p>
                <h2>Most common</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Push-ups</li>
                    <p>
                        Performed face down on the floor, palms against the floor under
                        the shoulders, toes curled upwards against the floor. The arms are
                        used to lift the body while maintaining a straight line from head
                        to heel. The arms go from fully extended in the high position to
                        nearly fully flexed in the low position while avoiding resting on
                        the floor. This exercise trains Chest, shoulders, and triceps. An
                        easier version of this exercise consists of placing the hands on a
                        wall and then bending and straightening the arms.
                    </p>
                    <li>Sit-ups</li>
                    <p>
                        A person lies on their back with their legs bent. They bend at the
                        waist and move their head and torso towards their legs. They then
                        lower themselves back down to the start position. For people who
                        find it difficult to get down onto the ground, a similar range of
                        motion can be achieved by standing with the legs slightly bent,
                        and then bowing slightly and straightening up again.
                    </p>
                    <li>Squats</li>
                    <p>
                        Standing with feet shoulder-width apart, the subject squats down
                        until their thighs are parallel with the floor; during this
                        action, they move their arms forwards in front of them. They then
                        return to a standing position whilst moving their arms back to
                        their sides. Squats train the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves,
                        gluteal muscles, and core. The height of the squat can be adjusted
                        to be deeper or shallower depending on the fitness level of the
                        individual i.e. if someone struggles with exercise they can do
                        half or quarter squats. They are among the most versatile
                        calisthenic exercises because they can be performed easily in most
                        environments and with a limited amount of space.
                    </p>
                </ul>
                <h2>Common</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chin-ups and pull-ups</li>
                    <p>
                        Chin-ups and pull-ups are similar exercises but use opposite
                        facing grips. For a chin-up, the palms of the hands are facing the
                        person as they pull up their body using the chin-up bar. The
                        chin-up focuses on the biceps muscles, rather than the latissimus
                        dorsi muscle which is the focus of the pull-up. For a pull-up, the
                        bar is grasped using a shoulder-width grip. The subject lifts
                        their body up, chin level with the bar, and keeping the back
                        straight throughout. The bar remains in front of the subject at
                        all times. The subject then slowly returns to starting position in
                        a slow controlled manner. This primarily trains the lats or upper
                        back muscles, as well as the forearms.
                    </p>
                    <li>Dips</li>
                    <p>
                        Done between parallel bars or facing either direction of trapezoid
                        bars found in some gyms. Feet are crossed with either foot in
                        front and the body is lowered until the elbows are in line with
                        the shoulders. The subject then pushes up until the arms are fully
                        extended, but without locking the elbows. Dips focus primarily on
                        the chest, triceps, and deltoids, especially the anterior portion.
                    </p>
                    <li>Handstand</li>
                    <p>
                        A handstand is the act of supporting the body in a stable,
                        inverted vertical position by balancing on the hands. In a basic
                        handstand, the body is held straight with arms and legs fully
                        extended, with hands spaced approximately shoulder-width apart.

                    An increasing number of outdoor fitness training areas and outdoor
                    gyms are being built around the world. Some are designed especially
                    for calisthenics training and most are free to use by the public.
                    Calisthenics parks have equipment like pull-up bars, monkey bars,
                    parallel bars, and box jumps at one location. Freely accessible
                    online maps exist that show the location and sample photos of
                    calisthenics parks around the world.
